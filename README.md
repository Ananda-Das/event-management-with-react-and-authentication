[Live Site](https://react-event-management-c133e.web.app)

My Event Management project is used for Corporate Events. To make this Project I have used React.js with CSS Framework Tailwind & daiusyui. For Authentication, I have used Firebase.

In this Project, a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see our event services, our talented speakers, and ticket prices;
- A user can easily redirect from one page to another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular event details a user needs to login themselves to our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photo URL & password.
- After successful registration user can log in to see the event details & his profile & previously booked event list.
- User can also log in with their existing Google account.
